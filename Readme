- Angular Frontend 
    - Has own source code folder. 
    - In angular.json change outputPath to the wwwroot folder in the API folder
    - Thus when built, this copies the frontend files into the API/wwwroot folder (app.UseDefaultFiles() => uses index.html)
- Asp.Net Backend served at the moment in fly
    -  Containerised using docker
- Postgres DB is used
    - For Heroku we had to connect to the postgres db instance whose address was dynamically generated by heroku on startup
    - This snippet must be replaced with a valid connStr for connecting to the postgres db instance on fly
- Environment Variables need to be configured based on the appsettings.json file
    - DATABASE_URL
    - CloudinarySettings:CloudName
    - CloudinarySettings:ApiKey
    - CloudinarySettings:ApiSecret
    - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT (If used other than for the postgres db)
    - TokenKey (Generate secure password, required for identity validation) 

To login for testing :  
Random Username from the newuserdata.json
eg =>
username: elisa
password: Pa$$word
